                <h2>Why MidEvils</h2>
                <p>MidEvils has proven that great brands, great art, and great collector experiences never go out of style &mdash; regardless of market conditions.</p>
                <blockquote>"There's a lot of reasons that NFTs have 'died' over the past year and a half&hellip; but the art was never the reason."</blockquote>
                <p>In fact all the "corny" stuff &mdash; building a collection, commissioning someone to paint your PFP, getting excited about the lore, meeting up with your homies at an event &mdash; that was the meat the whole time. That's still the real value.</p>
                <blockquote>"And so that's why we made MidEvils. So that we could try to bring some of that fun and love back to NFTs."</blockquote>
                <div class="sig">Sincerely,<br><strong>Infinite Fun</strong></div>

        <!-- The Art -->
        <div class="wrap">
            <h2>The Art</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center; max-width:660px; margin:0 auto 24px; font-size:1.05rem;">The illustrated collection is the best work Infinite Fun has ever done &mdash; paired with a 10 out of 10 collector experience. They believe the best way to create lasting web3 art activations is to match the physical experience with the digital.</p>

            <div class="parchment-box">
                <h3>8 Months in the Making</h3>
                <div class="timeline">
                    <div class="tl"><p>It started with simple medieval-themed characters drawn because they were cool and fun. The tagline "They're only half evil" had a funny &mdash; and yet truthful &mdash; ring to it.</p></div>
                    <div class="tl"><p>The early characters were disproportional and looked a little too cooked. Eyes too round, anatomy off. So the team went back to the drawing board.</p></div>
                    <div class="tl"><p>They fixed the jaw so it didn't protrude so far, made the eyes bigger and more "smug," and fixed the posture &mdash; giving the character more of an apathetic, chill look. More grounded in reality.</p></div>
                    <div class="tl"><p>After going through over 100 character drawings, they locked in the direction: a world big enough for a large-scale generative collection.</p></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">We built MidEvils into a large scale generative collection because we felt confident that the world was BIG enough for it. We knew we wanted to work within the MidEvils world for quite some time &mdash; so we wanted to create a collection and atmosphere that was ripe for growth.</div>

            <div class="card">
                <strong>The Balance:</strong> Each MidEvil has a little bit of "medieval" and a little bit of "modern." When creating a generative collection, you need a fine balance of traits that live in the world of Midland and traits based in our reality. The goal: every single MidEvil has some kind of zany medieval-styled trait and some kind of normal, relatable trait &mdash; so a holder can find themselves in their PFP.
            </div>

            <p>MidEvils are built on four races: <strong>Man</strong> represents the mind, <strong>Beast</strong> the body and raw emotion, <strong>Ghost</strong> the spirit, and <strong>Orc</strong> &mdash; born from the burn events, forged in battle. It is how we delegate these natures within our day-to-day lives that defines who we are.</p>
            <div class="card">Humans aren't perfect &mdash; in fact we are far from it. But we also have this side of us that is loving, caring&hellip; divine? People often say the greatest human experiences lie in the tension between all three.</div>
